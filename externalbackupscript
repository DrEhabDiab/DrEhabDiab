Here is the User Guide for our External Backup Bash Script:

1- Verifying External Backup Configuration on Your Server:
To confirm that the External Backup has been successfully added and activated on your server, use the following command:

```
# df -h | grep -E 'Filesystem|backup'
```

This command should return the backup path and display its size details. An example output is as follows:

```
Filesystem                           Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
//u382815.your-storagebox.de/backup  100G   67G   34G  67% /mnt/backup-server
```

2- Schedule and Location of External Backups:

The External Backup script is programmed to run four times daily, every six hours, at the following times: 00:00, 06:00, 12:00, and 18:00.
Each run creates a full, standalone copy of the backup. You can locate these four backup instances in the following directory:

```
# ls /mnt/backup-server
```

The output will list the backup directories, typically named as 'First', 'Second', 'Third', and 'Fourth'.

3- Structure of Backup Directories:

Each backup directory contains three subdirectories:

databases: This contains a .sql backup of each database on the server.
files: This includes a complete copy of the public_html directory for each account on the server.
sqldir: This holds a full copy of the /var/lib/mysql path.

4- Restoring a Backup:

To restore a backup, for example, the second backup of user 'alyazedi', follow these steps:

Databases:

To list available database backups for the user 'alyazedi':

```
ls -la /mnt/backup-server/Second/databases/alyazedi_*.sql
```

To restore a specific database, for example, alyazedi_a2wp144.sql, use:

```
mysql alyazedi_a2wp144 < /mnt/backup-server/Second/databases/alyazedi_a2wp144.sql
```

Please note, this restoration process is irreversible.

Files:

To restore public_html files:

4.1- Rename the current public_html directory:

```
mv /home/alyazedi/public_html /home/alyazedi/public_html-OLD
```

4.2 Copy the backup files to the desired location:

```
cp -R /mnt/backup-server/Second/files/alyazedi/public_html /home/alyazedi/
```

4.3 Set the appropriate ownership and permissions:

```
chown -R alyazedi:alyazedi /home/alyazedi/public_html/
chmod 755 /home/alyazedi/public_html/
```

Please follow these instructions carefully to ensure effective backup management and restoration.
